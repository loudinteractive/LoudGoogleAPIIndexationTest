# LoudGoogleAPIIndexationTest
Loud Interactive checked the Google Index for direct quotes pulled from the review copy. A sample set of PowerReviews URLs with review content and headlines were exported. Using the Google API and a custom built tool, Loud Interactive was able to verify both indexation and rankability of the reviews by comparing the URL list of where the quoted review content was taken and the URLs that ranked within Google for the review content.
